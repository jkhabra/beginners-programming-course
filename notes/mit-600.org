* Lecture: 1

** What weâ€™ll learn by the end of the course

- Computational thinking
  Write small pieces of code that do useful things

- Understand code written by others
  It is super useful to read code written by others

- Understand our abilities and limit
  Take description of a problem, and convert it into a programming problem

** Computation

 - Declarative knowledge
   - Tells you what something is, not how to do it
   - Closest it gets is allow us to test it
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   \sqrt{x} is a number ~y~ s.t y^2 = x and y != 0
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  - Imperative knowledge
   - Tells us how to do something
   - A sequence of instructions to do something
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - Start with a guess ~g~
   - If g^2 = x, stop, return g
   - else g = (g + x/g) / 2
   - repeat
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  - *Computation* is about capturing the process of coming up with imperative process to do something
  -  A computation is based on a fixed set of primitives which are used to create complex computation

** Programming Language

- There is no best programming-language, but some language are better at doing certain things than
  other languages

- Language used in this course Python, but the course is not about Python. It is about how to program,
  Python is only a programming language choice and once we know how to code in one language, we can learn
  a new language easily

- Different dimensions of a languages
  - High vs Low level
    Low level: Very close to hardware. Primitives are moving data from one location in memory to high
    level: Much richer set of primitives

- General vs targeted
  General:For general purpose programming. Can be used to do a lot of things e.g Python Targeted: Designed
  for a specific purpose, e.g Math

- Interpreted vs Compiled

  Interpreted: Interpreter work directly on source-code at runtime Compiled: Compiler code to
  intermediate from (Object code) which actually runs finally

- Python is
  - High level
  - General Purpose
  - Interpreted

- *Static semantics*: which programs are meaningful

- *Semantics*: relating to meaning in language or logic

- *Syntax*: what are legal expressions in language


* Lecture: 2

- Two things needed to write programs:
  - Representing data
    - Value and Type

  - Give instructions to manipulate that data
    - Expressions: operands and operators

  - Type Conversion: conversion of data types
    - e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      str(3) + 'bf'  # it prints 3bf
      #+END_SRC

  - Type Checking: Python checks the type of the operands before it applies things

** Operator Precedence
   - Exponentiation are done before you do multiplication & divison done before you do addirion & subtraction
   - If use /parentheses/ the calculation happened in parentheses before the other operator
     e.g
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     print(3+4*5) # its gonna be 23
     #+END_SRC
     There is other version with *Parenthese*
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     print((3+4) * 5) # it should be 35
     #+END_SRC

  - *Variables*: have own values
    - They are created assignment statement
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      print(s = 3 + 5) # it create a link from that name to value
      #+END_SRC
    - In python variable type is dynamic
      - Dynamic means it chnges depending on what the current value is
    - Use variable any place where you want to use value
    - Use variable names that make sense

  - *Colon*: Identifies a block of code

  - *Statements*: are legal commands that python can interpret such as print, assignment

  -*Straight line program*: It should be "program which executes in the sequence of instructions"

  - *Branching programs* is program that can change the order of instructions based on some test
    - That tast is usally a value of a variable
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      x = 15
      if (x/2) * 2 == x:
          print('Even')
      else:
          print('Odd')
      #+END_SRC

    - Indentation matters
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      x = 'j'
      if 'd' < x:
      print('Hello') # it gives you a error because of indentation
      #+END_SRC

    - *Iteratiion or Loops*: If condition is true, do something, but keep doing it till it ends
