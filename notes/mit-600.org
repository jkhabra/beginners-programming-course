* Lecture: 1

** What weâ€™ll learn by the end of the course

- Computational thinking
  Write small pieces of code that do useful things

- Understand code written by others
  It is super useful to read code written by others

- Understand our abilities and limit
  Take description of a problem, and convert it into a programming problem

** Computation

 - Declarative knowledge
   - Tells you what something is, not how to do it
   - Closest it gets is allow us to test it
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   \sqrt{x} is a number ~y~ s.t y^2 = x and y != 0
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  - Imperative knowledge
   - Tells us how to do something
   - A sequence of instructions to do something
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - Start with a guess ~g~
   - If g^2 = x, stop, return g
   - else g = (g + x/g) / 2
   - repeat
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  - *Computation* is about capturing the process of coming up with imperative process to do something
  -  A computation is based on a fixed set of primitives which are used to create complex computation

** Programming Language

- There is no best programming-language, but some language are better at doing certain things than
  other languages

- Language used in this course Python, but the course is not about Python. It is about how to program,
  Python is only a programming language choice and once we know how to code in one language, we can learn
  a new language easily

- Different dimensions of a languages
  - High vs Low level
    Low level: Very close to hardware. Primitives are moving data from one location in memory to high
    level: Much richer set of primitives

- General vs targeted
  General:For general purpose programming. Can be used to do a lot of things e.g Python Targeted: Designed
  for a specific purpose, e.g Math

- Interpreted vs Compiled

  Interpreted: Interpreter work directly on source-code at runtime Compiled: Compiler code to
  intermediate from (Object code) which actually runs finally

- Python is
  - High level
  - General Purpose
  - Interpreted

- *Static semantics*: which programs are meaningful

- *Semantics*: relating to meaning in language or logic

- *Syntax*: what are legal expressions in language


* Lecture: 2

- Two things needed to write programs:
  - Representing data
    - Value and Type

  - Give instructions to manipulate that data
    - Expressions: operands and operators

  - Type Conversion: conversion of data types
    - e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      str(3) + 'bf'  # it prints 3bf
      #+END_SRC

  - Type Checking: Python checks the type of the operands before it applies things

** Operator Precedence
   - Exponentiation are done before you do multiplication & divison done before you do addirion & subtraction
   - If use /parentheses/ the calculation happened in parentheses before the other operator
     e.g
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     print(3+4*5) # its gonna be 23
     #+END_SRC
     There is other version with *Parenthese*
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     print((3+4) * 5) # it should be 35
     #+END_SRC

  - *Variables*: have own values
    - They are created assignment statement
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      print(s = 3 + 5) # it create a link from that name to value
      #+END_SRC
    - In python variable type is dynamic
      - Dynamic means it chnges depending on what the current value is
    - Use variable any place where you want to use value
    - Use variable names that make sense

  - *Colon*: Identifies a block of code

  - *Statements*: are legal commands that python can interpret such as print, assignment

  -*Straight line program*: It should be "program which executes in the sequence of instructions"

  - *Branching programs* is program that can change the order of instructions based on some test
    - That tast is usally a value of a variable
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      x = 15
      if (x/2) * 2 == x:
          print('Even')
      else:
          print('Odd')
      #+END_SRC

    - Indentation matters
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      x = 'j'
      if 'd' < x:
      print('Hello') # it gives you a error because of indentation
      #+END_SRC

    - *Iteratiion or Loops*: If condition is true, do something, but keep doing it till it ends


* Lecture: 3

**  Basic elements of programming

- *Data* It is a collection of information

  - Such as int, string and boolean

- *Operations*: It takes a data and create a new data

  - Such as addition, multiplication and boolean

- *Commands*: gives an a authoritative order

  - There are few command those we seen before assignment, input, condition, branches and loop


** Good programming style

 - Put comments in code to highlight what you are doing and it makes easy to debug

 - Type Discipline: that you should check the types of operands before apply operator to them

 - Variables Names: should tell the purpose of the variable

   - Choosing meaningful name for variable is very important

 - /Testing/ all possible branches through a piece of code

   -  Make sure all inputs give you an output

 - *Iterative programs*: when a process or sequence is repeated in a program
   - A common iterations are loop
    e.g
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     x = 16
     ans = 0

     while ans * ans <= x:
       ans += 1

     print ans
     #+END_SRC

   - *Defensive Programming*: is that should behave in a consistent manner even in the case of unexpected conditions
     - if there is negative value or not a square number so we use defensive programming

        e .g
        #+BEGIN_SRC python
        ans = 0
        x = 16

        if x >= 0:

          while ans * ans < x:
          ans = ans + 1

          if ans * ans != x:
            print x ' is not a perfect square'
          else: print ans

       else: print x 'is a negative number'
        #+END_SRC

 - Exhaustive enumeration: it means go through all possible values of some parameter
   - Or in other words testing everything unit will find right answer

 - *For loop*: works on one elements at a time

 - *Tuple*: is an ordered sequence of elements

   - Tuple is immutable (it can not be changed)

   - Its representation is following a parameters
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     yo = (1, 3, 6, 8)
     #+END_EXAMPLE

 - Index starts from 0 in tuple, list, string and dictionary


* Lecture: 4

 - *Decomposition*: it is a way of putting structure onto code
   - Or in other words its a way of braking the code into modules
     - Modules can be reuse in multiple places

 - *Abstraction*: means give names to things
    So that the name captures the core of what a function or program does

   - In abstraction, we hide the details behind a name

   - *Return*: A return statement returns a value to the caller of the function


   - *Function*: capture a common pattern of computation

     - It breaks the code up into modules

     - Functions suppress the details

     - return statement has no meaning outside the function

     - Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( )

     - Functions use local bindings means that function's code has no effect on outside's code

     - Local bindings do not affect any global bindings
       e.g
        #+BEGIN_SRC python
       def test_bindings():
         x = 3 # x binds to test_binding

         if x % 2 != 0:
           return x
       x = 8 # that is global binding. I has no effect on test_bindings's x
       #+END_SRC

     - *Doc string* It tell what that function do

   - *Recursion*:  is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems  until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved
       e.g
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         def is_palindrome(s, indent):
           print indent, 'Palindrome called with', s

           if len(s) <=1:
             print indent, 'About to return True from base case'
             return True
           else:
             ans = s[0] == s[-1] and is_palindrome(s[1:-1], indent * indent)
             print indent, 'About to return', ans
             return ans
       #+END_SRC


* Lecture: 5

 - *Arbitrary precision integers*: are large numbers
   - You can make numbers as big as you want them to
     e.g
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     a = 2 ** 1000
     print a # it gonna print really really big numben
     #+END_SRC

 - *Float*: Programming languages represent what we think as real numbers

   - Float is short for floating piont
   - All programming languages represent numbers using the IEEE floating point
     - It stands for IEEE 754 floating point
     - it is a variant of scientific notation
     - It represent very large numbens
   - We represent the numbens in the form of a mantissa and exponent
   - Represent a floating point number as a pair of a mantissa and an exponent
   - Newer use double equals to compare ploatig point

 - Integers can not enumerate all guess

   - Because the reals are uncountables

 - *Successive Approximation*: is a method that tells each guess is better than the  previous guess

 - *Bi-section method* is the division of something into two equal parts

   - Then easily deterimne whether the answer lies to the left or the right


* Lecture: 6

- *Bisection method*  It is related to binary search
  - Bi-section is the division of something into two equal parts
  - Then easily deterimne whether the answer lies to the left or the right
  - It is ordered list means everything in left is smaller than right

- *Assert*: testing helps find bugs more quickly and with less pain

- *Regression testing*: is the process of testing changes to programs to make sure that the older programming still works with the new changes

- *Non-scalar types*: /Tuples/, /string/ they are immutable

- *Mutable types*: /Lists/, /Dictionary/

  - The value of list is not just characters, it can be numbens, characters, string & other lists

  - /Append/: It takes a list and adds elements in it

  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  Tech = ['mit', 'bla', 'tec']
   b = ['b', 'dd', 's']
   uni = []

   uni.append(Tech) # it gonna print [['mit', 'bla', 'tec']]
  #+END_SRC

  - Removing is easy in lists
    e.g
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    rm = [1, 'ee', 33, 'yo']

    rm.remove('ee') # it gonna print something like that [1, 33, 'yo']

    #+END_SRC


* Lecture: 7

- *List*: is a sequence of objects
  - Lists are mutable
  - Lists can be heterogeneous it means that the elements can be multiple different types
  - List assignment: When multiple lists bound to same objects if you change one of them other one gonna change automatically
    - Assignment has two separate path to the same object
      e.g
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      l1 = [1, 2, 3]
      l2 = l1
      print l2 # [1, 2, 3]

      l1[0] = 8
      print l2 # i gonna print [8, 2, 3]
      #+END_SRC

- *Dictionaries*: has a key value pair
  - Dictionaries are mutable like lists
  - They are heterogeneous but unlike lists they are not ordered
  - Keys are used as the indices
  - Dictionaries use hashing technique
  - Hashing allow us to retrieve keys in constant time

  - *Pseudo code*: is description of steps, to do a particular thing

    - It gives information what we need in our code

    - Flow of control the oder which thins are going to happen

    - Use abstraction to suppress some details

    - Debugging is easy with pseudo code

      - How it is a lot easier to modify the pseudo code as compared to real code


* Lecture: 8

- *Efficiency*: Time refers as the orders of growth
  - In efficiency there's two things we want to measure /space/ & /time/
  - *Space* is refers to how much computer memory does it take to complete a computation of a particular size
  - *Time*: is refers to how long does the algorithm implemented by program take to run

- *Asymptotic notation* means as in the limit as the size of the problem gets bigger how to characterize that goth
- *Big Oh notation* means that going to be an upper limit to the growth of a function as the input gets large
  e.g
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
f(x) eO(n)**2 # n measure the size of x
#+END_EXAMPLE
  - This is linear algorithm

  - *Linear Algorithms*: tend to be thins where, at one pass-through you reduce the problem by a constant amount by one

  - *Log Algorithms*: is one where you cut the size of the problem down by some multiplicative factor

  - *Quadratic Algorithms*: tend to have doubly-nested, triply-nested things are likely to be quadratic or cubic algorithms

    - In other words double loop algorithms are quadratic algorithms

    - Because doing one set of things & doing it some other number of times

  - Algorithms speeds depends on input


* Lecture: 9

 - *Selection Sort*

   - This algorithm first finds the smallest element in the list

   - Then swap it with the element in the first position

   - Then find the second smallest element and exchange it with the second element

   - This process goes on until the entire list is sorted

   - *Pseudo code*
     - Base case
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     if len(ls) <= 1:
      return ls
     #+END_SRC
    - Recursive case
      - First find the smallest element from the list
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      min_index = ls.index(min(ls))
      #+END_SRC
    - Swap min element with element at first position
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      ls[0],ls[min_index] = ls[min_index],ls[0]
      #+END_SRC
    - Do same with list without its first element
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
       return [ls[0]] + selection_sort(ls[1:])
    #+END_SRC

 - *Loop Invariant*: means that there is a property that is true of this structure every time through the loop
   - Loops starts off with the prefix being nothing
   - It keep increasing the size of the prefix by 1 unit it gets through the entire list
   - At which point there's nothing in the suffix and entire prefix is sorted
   - This process goes through the entire list, even if list is sorted before gets part way through

 - *Bubble sort*

   - Start by compairing first two elements

   - If the first element is greater than second then, swap the elements

   - If the first element is smaller than second, leave the elements as it is

   - This process goes on until first and last element of the list is compared

   - If there are n elements to be sorted then, the process is repeated n-1 times

   - Because with each iteration the smaller element in the list bubbles up towards the first

   - *Pseudo code*
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
      for i in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
          if ls[i] > ls[i + 1]
            ls[i], ls[i+1] = ls[i+1], ls[i]
        return ls
     #+END_SRC


* Lecture: 10

- *Search*: To look for specific data in a file
  - A search implies either scanning content sequentially or using algorithms to compare multiple indexes to find a

- *Amortization*: is an accounting term that refers to the process of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over a period of time

  - It also refers to the repayment of loan principal over time

- *Merge Sort*: It was invented in 1945 by 'John Von Neumann'

  - Merge sort uses the idea of divide and conquer

  - It divide the list in half

  - It keep dividing lists in half until that the only singletons left

  - After that it combine or merge the list

  - Algorithms for Merge sort
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def merge(left, right):
       result = []
       i,j = 0, 0

       while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
               result.append(left[i])
               i += 1
           else:
               result.append(right[j])
               j += 1

       while (i < len(left)):
             result.append(left[i])
             i += 1

       while (j < len(right)):
             result.append(right[j])
             j += 1

       return result
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def merge_sort(l):
      if len(l) < 2:
        return l[:]
      else:
        middle = len(l) / 2
        left = merge_sort(l[:middle])
        right = merge_sort(l[middle:])
        together = merge(left, right)
        return together
    #+END_SRC
  - Complexity of merge sort is n log n

- *Hashing*: is mapping any kind of data into integers

  - This is constant algorithm

  - It takes too much space in complex cases such as finger prints

  - They are really hard to create

- *Exceptions*:  handle expected errors


* Lecture: 11

- *Testing*: we run our program on some set of inputs and check the answer and say that's what we expected

  - In testing we compare an input output pair to a specification

  - There are two classes of testing /unit testing/ and /integration testing/

  - *Unit testing*: that validate each piece of the program independently

    - It tests individual functions

  - *Integration testing*: is the phase in which tested as a group

    - It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing

  - *Test Suite*: is small enough so that we can test it in a reasonable amount of time

    - But also large enough to give us some confidence


- *Reasoning*: is about an appropriate set of inputs to test it on it


- *Validation*: is a process designed to uncover problems

  - It increase confidence that our program does what we think it's intended to do

  - It's typically a combination of two things /Testing/ and /reasoning/

- *Debugging*: is process of ascertaining why the program is not working

  - Why it's failing to working properly

  - We study the events that led to an error

  - The goal of debugging is not eliminate one bug it should be to move towards a bug free program

  - The two best debugging tools are /print statement/ and /reading/

  - Debugging is simply a search process

  - When you debugging you should be systematic

  - /Systematic/ is when you looking for bug and find bug, then reducing the search time

  - *Scientific method*: is you start by studying the available data

  - /Performance debugging/: it tells why program is slow

  - /Defensive programming/: it will facilitate both validation and debugging

    - In defensive programming we use assert statement so that we catch problems early


* Lecture: 12

- *Optimization Problems*: is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions

  - It can be divided into two categories depending on whether the functions are attempting to maximize or minimize

- *Shortest path problem*: can be defined for graphs whether undirected, directed, or mixed

    - It is defined for undirected graphs; for directed graphs the definition of path requires that consecutive vertices be connected by an appropriate directed edge

- *Traveling Salesperson*: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities

    - what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

- *Bin packing*: The problem of packing a set of items into a number of bins such that the total weight, volume, etc. does not exceed some maximum value

- *Sequence alignment problems*: for example aligning  DNA, DNA sequences

- *Knapsack problems*: is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value

  - Determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible

  - /0/1 knapsack problem/ A similar dynamic programming solution also runs in pseudo-polynomial time

- *Greedy algorithm*: is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

- /Problem reduction/ means is you are given some problem to solve that you have never seen before

  - Reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another problem

  - A reduction from one problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at least as difficult as the first

- *Dynamic programming*: s a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems

  - Solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions â€“ ideally, using a memory-based data structure

  - The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a  modest expenditure in storage space

* Lecture: 13

  - *Memoization*: an optimization technique where you cache previously computed results

    - Return the cached result when the same computation is needed again

  - *Optimization problems*: There are two things to look for first overlapping sub-problems

    - Other one was optimal substructure

    - The notion is that you can get a globally optimal solutions to sub-problems

    - But this is not true to all problems

  - *Decision Tree*: is a decision uses a tree-like graph and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility

    - It is one way to display an algorithm

* Lecture: 14
- In dynamic programming we trade time for space

- At any problem that seems to have a natural recursive solution, think about where it can attack to dynamic programming

- If you got optimal substructure, and overlapping subproblems then dynamic programming can be used

- *Pseudo polynomial algorithm*: is an algorithm that's polynomial the size of the inputs

- /Numeric value/ that's exponential number in the number of digits

- *Module*: as a collection of related functions

  - Functions are refer to the using dot notation

  - Dot notation uses to avoid name conflicts

- *Classes*: In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program code template for creating objects

  - A class is a collection of objects with characteristics in common

- *Object*: An object is a collection of data and functions

- *Encapsulation* is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination

  - This combination of data and functions on that data is a very essence of objects oriented programming

- *Message passing metaphor* is about that one object can pass message to another object

  - The receiving object respond by executing one of its methods on the object

* Lecture: 15

- *Class*: is a template for creating instance of an object

  - *Initializer or __init__*: is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated

    - init creates a pointer to the instance

  - *Self*: signifies an instance of a class

    - Whenever a new instance of a class is created, "self" indicates that it will have its own variables that aren't shared with other instances

    - Self will always point to particular instance

    - self is a conventional name, it could be any name

  - *Methods*: can access the value of the specific instance

  - *__str__*: print statement to compute the "informal" string representation of an object

  - *__cmp__*: uses for comparing values

  - *Operator overloading*: that allows same operator to have different meaning according to the context

  - /dir/ returns a list of all the methods that are associated with in class

    - Those could be created by you and those are know as fields

    - Both methods and fields altogether called attributes of the instance

- *Shallow equality*: two things (objects) point to exactly the same referent in memory

- *Deep equality*: is if the values are equivalent

  - It supports both primitive values and objects

  - Strict equals ( === ) means the values are equivalent

* Lecture: 16

 - *Data Hiding*: is used to hide internal object details

   - Data hiding ensures exclusive data access to class members

   - It protects object integrity by preventing unintended or intended changes

   - Python does not enforce data hiding

 - *__init__*: is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated

   - init creates a pointer to the instance

 - *__cmp__*: is comparison method

   - It compare two instances of an object

   - It returns three values

     - A negative number if x is less than y

     - Zero if x is equal to y

     - A positive number if x is greater than y

   - The built-in cmp() function will typically return only the values -1, 0, or 1

 - *__str__*: is print statement to compute the "informal" string representation of an object

 - *Inheritance*: A class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another class, called the superclass

   - A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass

   - Actions on the child imply an action on the parent

   - Actions on the child override the action on the parent

   - Actions on the child alter the action on the parent

 - *Shadowing*: occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (method, or inner class) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope

   - At the level of identifiers this is known as name masking

   - The outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner identifier is said to mask the outer identifier
     e.g
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     x = 0

     def outer():
       x = 1

     def inner():
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)

     inner()
     print("outer:", x)

     outer()
     print("global:", x)

     # prints
     # inner: 2
     # outer: 1
     # global: 0

     #+END_SRC
 - *iter and next*: iter creates method that's going to give you a pointer to the place in the structure

   -/ next/ literally goes along the structure giving you the next element
