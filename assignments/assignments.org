* Assignment 1

** Problem 2

 - Find sum of logs of prime numbers b/w 1 and number ~n~
   and save it in ~prime_logs_sum~
 - Then find the logs of the ~n~
 - After that find the ratio of ~prime_logs_sum~ and ~n~

* Assignment 2

** Problem 3
- *_is_possible (num : integer)*
  - Returns True if it is possible to make a combination of
    6, 9, 20 which is equal to ~num~

  - To achieve that use loop inside loop
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
     for x in range(0, num):
       for y in range(0, num):
         for z in range(0, num):
           if (6x + 9y + 20z) == num:
             return True
     return False
    #+END_SRC

- *max_impossible (num : integer)*

  - Return the biggest number that can't be make a combination of 6, 7, 8

  - IF is_possible return True 5 time constantly

    - Then we need to find last False number

      - To achieve that we need two variables count that contain how many times num is True

      - max_num that would contain false numbers

      - Then use for loop to do other stuff
